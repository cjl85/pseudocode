1) What is a hash table?

A hash table is a type of data structure that stores each value by linking it to a key, forming key-value pairs.

2) What is hashing?

Hashing is the conversion from a string to a numerical index.

3) How does a hash table store data?

Once a hash table can figure out its hash code, it can then use that as a key
and determine where to place the key-value pair.

4) How are hash tables and objects different?

Hash tables implement key/value pairs, keys can be any data type.

Objects can implement key/values pairs but keys must be strings or symbols.

5) Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:

A list of pets and their unique names.

- Object

The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend.

- Object

The name and location of every company in a given city.

- Hash Table

All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual.

- Hash Table

The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact.

- Object


6) Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers.
Store this information in a hash table.

customerData = {
  customer : 'John Smith',
  address : '1 Way Street',
  number : '0604',
}

const hashTable = {};

addCustomer = customerData => {
  hashTable[customerData.number] = customerData
};

searchCustomer = customerNumber => {
  return hashTable[customerNumber]
};

hashTable = {
  '0604' : {
    customer : 'John Smith',
    address : '1 Way Street',
    number : '0604',
  },
  '0702' : {
    customer : 'Michael Doe',
    address : '2nd Street',
    number : '0702',
  },
}


7) Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.

const hashtable = {};

storeInventory = {
   furniture : 'bed',
    location : 'B',
          id : '234',
}

addInventory = storeInventory => {
  hashTable[storeInventory.furniture] = storeInventory
};

searchInventory = inventoryID => {
  return hashTable[inventoryID]
};

8) Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date.
Use hash tables to store the necessary data.

const hashTable = {};

newspaperData = {
  publisher : 'Atlas',
       date : '1-1-90'
}

addNewspaper = newspaperData => {
  hashTable[newspaperData.number] = newspaperData
};

searchNewspaper = newspaperPublisher => {
  return hashTable[newspaperPublisher]
};

hashTable = {
  '1-1-90' : {
    publisher: 'Atlas'
  }
};
