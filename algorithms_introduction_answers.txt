1) Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

Making coffee;
- INIT coffee pot, coffee, cup
- METHOD turn on coffee pot with coffee
- METHOD pour coffee into cup
END

Washing dishes;
- INIT scrub daddy, dishsoap, dishes
- METHOD put dishsoap on scrubdaddy
- METHOD clean dishes
- IF dish is dirty, clean, else put away

Bowling:
- INIT bowling ball, pins
- METHOD roll bowling ball to set amount of pins
- IF remaining pins are zero, return strike
- ELSE remaining pins are greater than zero, return remaining pins
- METHOD reset pins

2) As with the knot algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve the problem. It is essential to try to pick the best algorithm for a situation. Name three companies who created an algorithm that made them successful, e.g., Google's search algorithm. It doesn't need to be a tech example (such as a recipe or manufacturing a product). Google's algorithm produces more relevant results than other search engines; what about each of your cases make them stand out?

COMPANIES:

Tesla - Revolutionized the way to harness electricity in a manner that reduces the need for oil/gas in cars.

Nintendo - Innovative in their design, approach, and layout of their video games system and games.

Gutenberg Printing Press - Historically changing invention that allowed for much quicker production of print material while reducing manual labor.

Tesla the inventor is probably the most impressive of the group. Figured out a way to harness free energy
and many practical applications for it.

3) Hypothesize about what constitutes an efficient algorithm versus an inefficient algorithm.

Efficient algorithm

- Goal is clear and understandable
- Steps are written out in clear, concise manner
- If steps followed, will take a certain amount of time

Inefficient algorithm

- Reader doesn't know the goal or gist right away
- Unclear steps/directions
- Doesn't layout amount of time it could take
