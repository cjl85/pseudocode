Why do programmers use pseudocode?

Pseudocode is useful in that it lays out what you're trying to
build by describing it as close to plain English as possible.

By starting this way, through its easy to read syntax and expressed intent,
you can develop algorithms and figure out to approach problems quicker. 

If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

It would not run as the pseudocode would not make sense to the computer.

1)

Make function that has two parameters, (num1, num2)
if num1 is greater than num2 then console log num1
else if num2 is greater than num1 then console log num2


2)

Make function with a variable i defined within it
Start a for loop, with i = 1, then i is less than or
equal to 100, then increment it by 1 with i++
Then we want to console log i in brackets

3)

Make function with parameter called entry
and we want to return the array of data with
a built-in method called find() and have the entry
in the argument

4)
const phoneBook = [arbitrary info of entries];

const searchPhonebook = (entry) => {
    return phoneBook.find(entry)
};
